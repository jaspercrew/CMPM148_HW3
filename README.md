Food Fusion


  A two-player role playing game centered around creating food. Some basic food knowledge is necessary. You are all talented chefs from different backgrounds and are looking to create new culinary experiences. 

  Required Materials
  Deck of Playing Cards (No Jokers)

  Draw a card from the deck. The number will correspond to the genre for the dish. This could be anything from a sandwich to a stew or a pizza. It will simply represent the form and structure. 

    Ace - Stew
    2 - Pizza
    3 - Dip
    4 - Fried Rice
    5 - Frittata
    6 - Cocktail
    7 - Ice Cream
    8 - Sushi
    9 - Ramen
    10 - Fries
    J - Hot Dog
    Q - Burger
    K - Pie

  The suit will correspond to the theme of the dish. This will determine its overall flavor profile.

    Hearts - Sweet
    Spades - Salty
    Clubs - Spicy
    Diamonds - Sour


  Each player then takes turns adding something to the dish based on the theme and genre. It can be an ingredient, topping, cooking process, etc. They must explain what addition they incorporate into the dish and how it adds to the previous additions. Repeat until there are 8 total additions (or youâ€™ve run out of ideas). 

  In the end, the players should end up with a culinary amalgamation. All the players should collaborate to give the final dish a name. 

  As someone who really enjoys the process of cooking and experimenting with new ingredients, I wanted to create a game that encapsulated that creative process while also adding an element of collaboration. After an online playtest run of this RPG with one of my friends, I had to make a few modifications to the game. First, there were a variety of instructional modifications I had to implement in order to streamline the game process and make it less confusing. Also, in the original version, I noticed that there was not very much dramaturgical responsibility on the players. In order to mitigate this issue, I added the naming of the dishes to give the players more opportunity for creativity.
  I think that I still need to add more room for creativity and player dialogue, as the game is quite linear and overly structured at the moment.

  Players interact with the game materials mostly through the choice of addition they bring (narrative prompts) and the deck of cards (game materials). 
  Players interact with other players through the collaborative nature of adding new things to the dish and also with the naming of the dish.
